# Wall Clock

Assumptions:

* There is no seconds hand and the minute hand snaps to the minute mark
* We want the smallest angle between the hands

```
npm run clock_angle [time in digital format] [radians or degrees]
```

Defaults to current time and degrees.

Examples:

```
npm run clock_angle
npm run clock_angle 3:20
npm run clock_angle 12:42 radians  
```
